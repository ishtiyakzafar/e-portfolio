                        My journey of discovery started when I started reaching out to the
                        communities through the various community activities. I was
                        volunteering with Community Development Council (NorthWest) and
                        was also in the Executive Committee of Zone 9 Residents'
                        Committee. My Saturday afternoons were dedicated to RDA (Riding
                        for the Disabled Association) where I had the golden opportunity
                        to work with disabled children, teaching them to ride horses /
                        ponies. On an ad-hoc basis, I was volunteering with the Rotary
                        Club (Singapore West) as well as the Lions' Club. On top of these,
                        I made sure I was there for family and friends as I ensured I had
                        fulfilment from every commitment.

                    <p>
                        Soon I anchored myself with DAS Association and here I am, engaged
                        in a very rewarding career, helping dyslexic learners achieve, and
                        also having the opportunity to pursue higher education - Master of
                        Arts (Instructional Design and Technology). I witness myself
                        growing and developing as an individual as well as a team with the
                        Association and am thankful for that.

                    <h1>My Professional Philosophy</h1>
                    <p>
                        My teaching philosophy is rooted in a constructivists approach in
                        that learners must be actively involved in the process of
                        constructing their own meaning and knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My mission as a teacher is to understand my students and their
                        social, emotional, and intellectual needs so I can inspire them to
                        develop lifelong learning and critical thinking skills. I
                        encourage these skills by teaching through a rigorous and wide
                        range of reading, writing, vocabulary, authentic discussion,
                        cooperative, collaborative, and digital activities that have
                        meaningful connections to the English Language as well the
                        fundamental phonics concepts. I promote equity by placing a high
                        value on differentiated instruction because I appreciate that
                        learners are individuals, all with unique backgrounds and diverse
                        levels of prior knowledge as I do not at all believe that one size
                        fits all.

                    <h1>Me now...</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Covid-19 pandemic has taught me to be more aware of the
                        community I live in. It made me think of how the pandemic has
                        affected not just myself but the people who were having it hard
                        even before the pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        This prompted me to reach out to foreign workers in Singapore
                        through the It's Raining Raincoats initiative - where volunteers
                        basically teach foreign workers to speak in English and develop
                        their speaking skills.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I hope to be able to do this for as long as I can!</p>
